===========================

Status: ready/tested 
---------------
Last test: 22 January 2015

Overview
--------
A Refine project to model Manchester expenditure data. User will need to edit select URIs and labels to ensure dates are appropriately assigned. Using the RDF skeleton on Open Refine, identify the following:
- 2nd Root Node [(Inv Transaction URI)] -> [(row index) URI]
- 3rd Root Node [(row index) URI] -> [(row index) URI]
- 3rd Root Node [(row index) URI] -> [(row index)] 
- 3rd Root Node [(row index) URI] -> [Paid Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-MM]
                                  -> [Paid Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-Q?]
                                  -> [Paid Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-H?]
                                  -> [Paid Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-YYYY]

Click to open the greyed out boxes. In the bottom right section 'Use custom expression' section, click to open the 'preview/edit' box, and edit the dates using the appropriate format.

Please see video tutorials for a walkthrough on how to code Council spending data into linked data, and then upload to the GMDSP datastore.
