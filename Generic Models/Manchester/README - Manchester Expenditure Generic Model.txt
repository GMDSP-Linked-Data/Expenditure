===========================

Status: ready/tested 
---------------
Last test: 22 January 2015

Overview
--------
A Refine project to model Manchester expenditure data. User will need to edit select URIs and labels to ensure dates are appropriately assigned. Using the RDF skeleton on Open Refine, identify the following:
- 2nd Root Node [Transaction Number URI] -> [(row index) URI]
- 3rd Root Node [(row index) URI] -> [(row index) URI]
- 3rd Root Node [(row index) URI] -> [(row index)] 
- 3rd Root Node [(row index) URI] -> [Invoice Payment Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-MM]
                                  -> [Invoice Payment Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-Q?]
                                  -> [Invoice Payment Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-H?]
                                  -> [Invoice Payment Date URI] -> [http://.../YYYY-YYYY]                                      

Click to open the greyed out boxes. In the bottom right section 'Use custom expression' section, click to open the 'preview/edit' box, and edit the dates using the appropriate format.

Please see video tutorials for a walkthrough on how to code Council spending data into linked data, and then upload to the GMDSP datastore.

Use case
--------

This could be applied to a dataset containing council expenditure information. For example

- Over Â£500 Spend Excel/CSV files
- http://www.manchester.gov.uk/downloads/download/5859/open_data_-_spend_over_500_20142015

Ontologies
----------
This work utilises the Data.Gov.Uk Payments Ontology to define types of payments and the bodies, departments and suppliers involved. Please refer to the following site for clarity on which label to use.
